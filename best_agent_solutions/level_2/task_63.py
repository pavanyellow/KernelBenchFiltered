# We'll fuse the ReLU into a custom Triton kernel. We let PyTorch handle
# the dense matrix multiplication (cublas) for self.linear, then we apply
# the elementwise ReLU in Triton for added efficiency. 
# This respects the user instructions: 
#  - We do not write our own matmul kernel (cublas is already optimized).
#  - We only do a single-elementwise kernel that does ReLU. 
#  - The input shape (128, 1024) and output shape (128, 512) are both powers of two 
#    in their total element counts (128*512 = 65536, which is 2^16), so no masks are needed.
