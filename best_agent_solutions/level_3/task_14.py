# This internal class preserves the same constructor, parameters, and initialization.
# We optimize the forward pass by:
#  1) Not storing intermediate features in a list; instead, we concatenate directly to "x".
#  2) Using channels-last memory format consistently.
#  3) Scripting (JIT) the model for further optimizations.
#  4) (Optional) Dropping Dropout if p=0.0, but we keep it so code alignment remains identical.
